          <h3>Why Venice?</h3>
          <h2>Venice, the real Italy</h2>
          <p>
            Venice was once the location of the heart of trade between Europe,
            Central Asia, and the Middle East, and it became extremely wealthy
            in the process, at one time commanding respect as the wealthiest
            city in Europe. The republic was ruled by a Doge (the head of state,
            who was elected for life) and a series of councils.25 May 2020

          <p>
            Venice is unique environmentally, architecturally, and historically,
            and in its days as a republic the city was styled la serenissima
            (“the most serene” or “sublime”). It remains a major Italian port in
            the northern Adriatic Sea and is one of the world's oldest tourist
            and cultural centres.
